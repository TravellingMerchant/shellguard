  "description" : "Welcome to the Shellguard: Starbound Expansion remaster!\n\nThis mod is a remake of my old Shellguard mod, seen here. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=763788379\n\nWe have a public discord here! https://discord.gg/efMVY8w\n\n\n\nThis mod is a full expansion to Starbound, focused around a new faction called Shellguard. Shellguard is a large scale mercenary group as well as a weapons, robotics and gear manufactuer. The mod includes a MASSIVE amount of new weapons and gear, new missions, dungeons, new bosses and even more to come in the future!\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/aSr6LgE.png[/img]\n\nTo begin with the mods content, you can craft a shop from the third tier inventors table. From there, you can buy all sorts of gear and weapons, plus you'll be able to buy a teleporter to the hub world of the Shellguard mod. A large outpost on an alpine world, the hub will give you access to all sorts of content, such as quests, unique items, special story missions and more.\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/bzgF7fB.png[/img]\n\nSome of the features of this mod, listed:\nA completely lore and theme friendly mod to the base game, that won't conflict with other mods!\nAn incredible amount of fun, unique guns, including a custom gun system so you can build your own!\nRobots such as drones, tanks and sentry guns that you can create that will help you fight, move around and explore!\nA brand new hub world, seperate from the outpost.\nMercenary missions and Arena fights, complete them for money and loot!\nShellguard related story missions.\nThemed dungeons for planet generation!\nDifficult end-game content, which the base starbound lacks!\nTerrifying new bosses, with more on the way!\nUnique tools to help you navigate around planets. \nPowerful base defenses, such as automatic guns and flak turrets!\nBrutal new mech parts!\nThemed Decorations!\nFlyable Gunships!\nAnd much, much more!\n\nThis mod should be completely compatible with any other mod out there. (With exception of the original mod.) This includes Frackin Universe, which it is fully compatible with. \n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/tct3vLV.png[/img]\n\nPlease consider donating to me to help me develop the mod. Game development isn't cheap and your support would go a LONG way!  https://www.patreon.com/MerchantPixels\n\nI have many plans to expand on this mod, enough content plans to rival the main game's story in size, or even bigger. \nIf you want to see what I'm working on, or even contribute yourself, then please join the discord at the top of the page.\n\nYour support would go a long way to developing this mod!\n\nContributors: Princess of Evil, Degranon, Chester, Mikenyes, Mr Yellowjacket, Nebulox, Loib, Omega, CS, Daggette, Armok, Easer Cat, Yes.",
